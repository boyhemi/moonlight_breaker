- The scoring system
The game will save the high score and the current score using PlayerPrefs.
The player will obtain points when the horizontal blocks or vertical blocks are cleared.
- Game Over Screen
This will appear if the player runs out of moves or space. The design language of the screen is like a paper
so the retry button will blend in the screen and don't worry, it's clickable and working!
